#Description

Most of Define the Problem will be accomplished outside of XDATA tools (largely in the challenge problem assignment interface). This state includes: receiving tasking, refining the request (perhaps with the requestor), defining specific goals and objectives for the request, specifying research questions and/or hypotheses to test, and justifying the tasking.
