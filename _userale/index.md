#Background

The User Activity Logging Engine, or User-ALE, is a logging mechanism used to quantitatively assess the behavioural and cognitive state of a data analyst while interacting with Big Data Exploitation Systems (BDES).

To accurately measure the cognitive state of the user, tool developers associate model based workflow states with each user action.  Did a user pan a map? Then they are exploring.  Did a user click a search button? Then they are getting new data.  These model based activities can then be processed to measure hidden empirical states that describe more accurately the user's workflow and behaviour.

#Who is the package for?
This package is for developers creating **User** facing tools, and who would like to log the users interaction with this tool, in order to gain an insight into the behavioural and cognitive state of the user.
