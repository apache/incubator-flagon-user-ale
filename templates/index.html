<h4>Background</h4>       
<p>The Data Activity Logging Engine, or Data-ALE, is a logging mechanism used to quantitatively assess the behavioural and cognitive state of a data analyst while interacting with Big Data Exploitation Systems (BDES).</p>

<p>
  To accurately measure the cognitive state of the user, tool developers associate model based workflow states with each user action.  Did a user pan a map? Then they are exploring.  Did a user click a search button? Then they are getting new data.  These model based activities can then be processed to measure hidden empirical states that describe more accurately the user's workflow and behaviour.  
</p>

  More complete descriptions of the model based workflow activities can be found to the left.

<h4>Who is the package for?</h4>
<p>This package is for developers creating <b>User</b> facing tools, and who would like to log the users interaction with this tool, in order to gain an insight into the behavioural and cognitive state of the user.</p>
