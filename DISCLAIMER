Apache Flagon is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Incubator project. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.
